# FREE HTML and CSS Card Templates

In this project, I design and share card templates using popular UI libraries. These templates are freely available for everyone to use. I believe these templates will be useful for various web projects. If you find these templates helpful, please consider adding a star to this repository and following me.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of card templates designed using the following UI libraries:

- Material UI
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS

Each UI library has its dedicated folder within the repository. You can explore and use these templates to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of your web projects.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder of the UI library you're interested in (e.g., `material-ui`, `bootstrap`, or `tailwind-css`).
3. Inside the folder, you'll find individual HTML and CSS files for each card template.
4. Copy the code of the desired template into your project.
5. Customize the template according to your needs by editing the HTML and CSS.
